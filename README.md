**Abstracts**


_This document explores various alternatives for generating suitable document for printing to be used in a web mapping application._


Current situation
=================

The swiss federal geoportal [map.geo.admin.ch](https://map.geo.admin.ch) uses a customed developped server-side printing application ([service-print]((https://github.com/geoadmin/service-print)) based on a [forked](https://github.com/geoadmin/mapfish-print/tree/2.1.x_geoadmin3) of [MapFish Print v2](http://www.mapfish.org/doc/print/) and a [Python Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application to allow for multiserver use and multipage PDF document generation. Currently, it runs in a Docker auto-scalling group, with one server at night and two during the day.

## Capabilities

* Printing all 2D layers from map.geo.admin.ch, including import GPX/KML and most WMTS/WMS 
* Generating an A4/A3 PDF 1.3 at 150 DPI (not a technical limitation)
* Generating a multipage PDF for Zeitreise (one year per page)
* Synchronous print for single page, asynchronous for multipage
* 247'198 PDF page generated the last 90 days (500-5'000 per day) and 1'383 multipage print (0 to 50 per day)
* Dockerized application running on a auto-scaling cluster (time-based)
* Using an extend version of the standar print procotol used by GeoMapFish/GeoExt/GeoServer
* Merging legends of complex layers (geology) to the end of the PDF document.


## Shortcomings

* Print only 2D map
* Imported WMS and WMTS layers won't be printed if remote server do not support LV95 projection (EPSG:2056).
* WMTS layers are added as indivual tiles to PDF, for every layers (way too much information if some layer are fully opaque) 232 MB for Zeitreise only, 376MB (25 pages)
* Very limited support for Vector. Luckily, imported vector do not support many style
* Symbols size for Raster layer (Vector symbol are adapted to print resolution)
* MapFish v2 is not developped anymore. swisstopo is patching a fork.

## Performances

The 95th percentile for all print jobs are between 3.7 and 5.0 s (only time for generation, without download)

Generation time (POST to response): 1.14 ± 0.19 s (n=256, every 5 minutes)


Error rate: last month 1'082 errors for 97'988 success (about 1.09%)


What is printing?
================

In the context on web mapping application, printing is generally seen as as a way to generate a file, like an image or a PDF, suitable to be sent to an office printer.
But even in this context, some people may primarly interested in the PDF file, not a paper impression. This is a huge difference.

This is a bit restrictive, as PDF file may be also saved for offline use. The advent of 3D data and application, also brings new possiblities and challenges.



What should be printed?
======================

Since its inception, maps have been decorated with more or less useful features.

Map data
--------

### 2D

#### Raster
Source are generally satelite/aerial imagery, and scan of legacy maps (historical maps)
Served usually as WMS and WMTS

#### Vector
Vector are now a few layer as GeoJSON, and imported GPX and KML

Question: rasterize data to print seems obvious, but it is definitely a loss of information.

  * Sync between server tools and

### 3D

* To convert to 2D or not? If so, rasterize or not?
* Render as 3D (export ?) for use with 3D printer or anything else (virtual world, KML, etc.)


### Time (4th dimension)

* Data changing over time (Zeitreise)
* Position changing over time (fly path)

How to render: multipage, movie?

Another challenge: mixing data with different rate of change and/or lacking data.


Non map data
------------

Non-map data provide useful informations

### Logo and corporate identity

Important or not, it gives a professinal look

### Disclaimer/copyright

Providing a clear delimitation between data which are from the geoportal and which data are 3rd party. Some remainder of copyright use.

### Title, note by user

Provide the user to give its work a title and notes

###Legend to the map

Some data are more complexe, and need an explanation. It could be as _simple_ as displaying the classification to a full grown geological explanation of the map.
 
### Scale, scalebar, norh arrow
Useful information for the orientation, and when hiking.

### QRcode, shortlink
Useful to recreate the map in the application online

### Table data (reporting)
Some infomarmation be easier to display as table. Not used in map.geo.admin.ch, but proposed by some printing application

### File metadata (if applicable)
Metadata are something useful for search engine if the main goal is to store the PDF.

### Grid
Various geographical grids, for orientation and use with GPS.

### Information on elements displayed
Could be the location of a search term in the simpliest form or additional information on a highlighted object (tooltips,etc.)





Tools, building bricks
======================


Browser
-------

### Rasterizing

HTML5, _toBlob()_, _toDataURL()_



### Export canvas to a vector format

As SVG or PDF (what libraries?)


Server-side rendering of GIS data
---------------------------------

Either vector or raster.


### Rasterizing of canvas

Challenges:
* Pretty slow
* How do you know the map is fully loaded and rendered?

#### SlimerJS (Firefox based)
* WebGL
* Not truely headless (?)

#### PhantomJS (WebKit based)
* No WebGL support

### Rasterizing/exporting data

* Mapserver
* Mapnik
* GDAL/Rasterio
* OWSlib

Print server
------------
* Mapfish print
* Geoserver print


Integrated print tools
----------------------

Need more testing...

* QGIS print
* ArcGis print
 

Other consideration
===================

* Scale and resolution of result
* WebGL
* Vectors in PDF
* PDF/A
* Legacy client (provide raster tiles)
* Vector style definition
* Mashup with other sorts of infos (diagram, plot, data tables)
* Movie (Zeitreise, Fly along path, etc.)
* Externalize compute power on client
* Performance (sync or async printing)
* WYSIWIG (symbol scaling, which LK to use)
* Grid
* Projection issue (projection of the data, target projection) --> deformation, scale, etc.
* Rasterize as a data protection tool
* High contrast map
* Export to other format
* Use on smartphone and tablet
* Ineractive application/API
* Multserver use, autoscaling, etc.
* KMZ with local file
* GeoPDF


Approaches
==========

Client side printing
--------------------
* WYSIWIG
* No complexe template
* No control of resolution

Server side
-----------


Mixed approach
--------------
Some elements are rendered client-side and then sent to the server, or only some operation are done server-side.


Integrated approach
-------------------

Tools like QGis and ArcGIS used to configure the layers. Configuration files, including styles, are used in the web application.
As both client and server are using the same configuration, printing may be done server-side.
